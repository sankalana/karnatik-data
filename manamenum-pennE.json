You latch on to one thing, and sway in its grip; anticipating the next thing, you move\rfrom one to the next and again, the next thing; when asked to focus on the good, you manage to \rgive one the slip; when told to 'leave it alone!', you hang on to it with firmer grip; you keep\rreverting to the same old thoughts; Let us lose ourselves in the new; you want the new, but are\rat the same time, are fearful of it!",
